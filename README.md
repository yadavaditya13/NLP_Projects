# NLP_Projects
This Repository will be holding some mini-projects that I will be doing on Natural Language Processing.

The first file in here is "speech-to-text_text-to-speech.py", which will uses two packages:
1) SpeechRecognition
2) pyttsx3

Using these two packages I performed 1) Speech-to-Text conversion using "recognize_google" method and then the 2) Test-to-Speech which will initialize the engine and make it read the discovered text from our (user's) speech.

Note: You can also use custom audio file by giving it as an input to the program by simply executing the script as:
python speech-to-text_text-to-speech.py --input "input audioFile path"
